# Brennan_CSCI2270_Final
/* for my project I'm going to provide information about different instruments, the user will be able to learn different facts and pieces of information about them.  They can select their favorite instruments and it will be added to a list, the user can add or remove different instruments from this list. They can also add instruments not already listed in the program.  They can then print lists of instruments by instrument type or alphabetically.  They can count the total number of instruments or just count the total number of instruments of a specific type.  They can also search to see if an instrument is already in the list of instruments. The information for the instruments will be stored in a struct in the form of a binary search tree. */
